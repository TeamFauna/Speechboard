<<Pippin: Hey!>>

<<Merry: Over here!>>

<<Pippin: <waving his arms> This way!>>

<Both Hobbits run away from Frodo. The Uruk-Hai troop follows them. Frodo makes a break for it, running in the opposite direction.>

<<Pippin: Its working!>>

<<Merry: I know its working! Run!>>

<Back at the hilltop, Legolas, Aragorn, and Gimli continue to fight the Uruk-Hai. In one smooth move, Legolas stabs one Uruk with an arrow then shoots it out at another. Gimli wields his axe. Aragorn stabs one behind his back.>

<Merry and Pippin run across an old stone bridge. At its far end, they stop and see Uruk-hai running towards them. The Uruks are closing in, both in front and behind. An Uruk runs up to them, raising his battleaxe. But Boromir comes charging in, knocks the Uruk back, and kills him with his own axe. He throws a knife at another. More close in.>

<Legolas kills Orc after Orc. He shoots down an Uruk who has closed in on Aragorn.>

<Three loud ox-horn blasts are heard.>

<<Legolas: The Horn of Gondor!>>

<<Aragorn: Boromir!>>

<He runs down the slope towards the sound, but Uruks are between him and Boromir. The forest sweeps by as he goes.>

<Boromir sounds the Horn of Gondor again. The Uruks attack Boromir.>

<Aragorn battles madly towards Boromir.>

<Boromir kills two more. Merry and Pippin take out some Orcs.>
